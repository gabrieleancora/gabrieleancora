## Hi! I'm gabriele, a sysadmin and programmer!

Currently I uploaded here only some school and university projects, so it may be look a bit dull, but you should get an idea on which programming languages do I prefer and which type of programs do I prefer doing. 

My favourite programming language is C#, and I really like PHP too, even if a lot of people don't think alike...  
I also find Python pretty useful and i know how to program in Java and C++.
